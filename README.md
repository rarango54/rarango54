- 👋 Hi, I’m Ramon Arango
- 👀 I’m interested in animation, rigging & modeling
- I made the Apollo & Artemis character rigs for maya
- Intending to make more
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use python in maya to build character rigs
- eventually making an auto rigger limited to symmetrical humanoid characters
- 💞️ I’m looking for some feedback on the readability of my scripts, do they make any sense?? ^^
- 📫 I'm @rarmango on insta
